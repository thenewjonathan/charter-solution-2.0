This project is set up similiar to the previous one I submitted in that you can pull it doen and run "npm start" in the console window of intellij, or if you're just using command line, just make sure you're in the directory with the project and it will pop an internet window up to show you my work. If you have any questions about anything here, feel free to reach out through Heidi and I would be happy to answer any questions you have. Look forward to meeting you and discussing opportunities with your company!

Thanks,
Jon Sansoucie
